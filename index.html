      <h3>Erjon Krasniqi</h3>
      <p> I'm currently an undergraduate studying Computer Science at City, University of London.
	I went to secondary school and 6th form at St Bonaventure's in Forest Gate, where I studied Computer Science for A Level and GCSE. 
	During 2020 I took a gap year and worked at Aberdeen Standard Investments on the Investment 20/20 program.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I used the bezier function to create a sort of boomerang type shape.
	To make it more interactive I decided to use the mouse functions as a way to get Co-ordinates for the shapes. 
	I ended up with a spiral which the user could then zoom in/ bring closer together and then zoom out of just by moving his mouse acorss the screen.
	I then used the randomness function to find random colours for the lines so that it would also look more lively.
